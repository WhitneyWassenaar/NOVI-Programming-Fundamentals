# NOVI Programming Fundamentals
## Course overview
This course teaches the basics of programming and helps you think like a programmer. Thinking like a programmer is necessary to understand what kinds of applications you can use and how to use them.

To learn the basics of programming, we use **Python**, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It is an intuitive and accessible language.

I learn programming through an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called **PyCharm**. After completing the course, I will be able to automate repetitive workflows, write scripts, and make processes more efficient.
