# Lesson 3: Control Structures and Lists

## Lesson Overview
In this lesson, I learn how to create and manipulate lists in a program. I explore how to slice lists, write list comprehensions, and use them effectively. Additionally, I expand my understanding of control structures and how they influence program flow.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson, I am able to:
- Understand what a terminal is and how to use basic terminal commands
- Work with version control using Git and GitHub
- Apply control structures such as `if`, `elif`, `else`, and loops
- Create, slice, and manipulate lists
- Use list comprehensions to write cleaner and more efficient code

## Terminal Commands

### Windows (PowerShell)
- `Set-Location ..` — Navigate to the parent directory  
- `Set-Location <directory>` — Navigate to a specific directory  
- `Get-ChildItem` — List files and directories  
- `New-Item -Path <filename>` — Create a new file  
- `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path <directoryname>` — Create a new directory  
- `python script_name.py` — Run a Python script  
- `py script_name.py` — Run a Python script  

### Linux / macOS
- `cd ..` — Navigate to the parent directory  
- `cd <directory>` — Navigate to a specific directory  
- `ls` — List files and directories  
- `touch <filename>` — Create a new file  
- `mkdir <directoryname>` — Create a new directory  
- `python script_name.py` — Run a Python script  
- `python3 script_name.py` — Run a Python script  

## Version Control with Git & GitHub
During this lesson, I work with Git and GitHub to manage my code. The following concepts are covered:

- Version control
- Git and GitHub
- Repositories
- Commits
- Cloning repositories
- Pushing changes
- `.gitignore`
- Control structures such as `while`, `if`, `elif`, and `else`

## Summary
Lesson 3 focuses on strengthening fundamental programming skills by combining control structures with list manipulation. These concepts are essential for writing structured, readable, and efficient Python programs and form an important foundation for more advanced programming topics.
